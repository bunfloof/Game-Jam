// The questions the boss asks, Typing of the Dead style. When all 5 of the
// boss's parts are broken it is stunned and asks a question: the question
// appears in big letters and 3 answer words float in front of the boss. The
// player TYPES one of them:
//   - the right answer -> critical hit on the boss,
//   - a wrong answer   -> the boss heals.
// The player only has about 10 seconds and zombies may still be around, so
// every question is SHORT and can be read at a glance.
//
// Boss calls QuizBank.Pick(usedFirstLetters) and gets a QuizQuestion (see
// QuizQuestion.cs) with its 3 answers already shuffled into a random order.
//
// HOW TO ADD A QUESTION: add one line to the Questions list below, like
//
//     Q("WHAT DO ZOMBIES CRAVE?", "BRAINS", "SALAD", "TOFU"),
//         the question              RIGHT    wrong    wrong
//
// The FIRST answer is always the right one (the game shuffles them later).
// Rules for a question (when you press Play, CheckQuestions below prints a red
// error in the Console naming any question that breaks one of them):
//   - the question: UPPERCASE, at most 40 characters, ends with "?", only
//     plain keyboard characters (no curly quotes, long dashes or emoji, which
//     the font cannot show), and never '<' or '>' (TextMeshPro would read
//     them as a rich-text tag);
//   - the answers: exactly 3, each ONE word of UPPERCASE letters A-Z only
//     (no digits, spaces, apostrophes or hyphens), 3 to 10 letters long;
//   - the 3 answers start with 3 DIFFERENT letters: the first key the player
//     types chooses the answer, so two answers may never share a first letter.
